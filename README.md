Colour modes:
Custom: you can use whatever colour you like
Random: generates random colour
Random++: Generates random colour that is high contrast to the second colour. Eg if background is white, it will not generate light blue text colour, or if text is dark blue it will not pick black for background
you can combine Random++ with Custom colour

Text render:
System default - uses default font hinting in windows, will anti aliase the pixels
Pixelated - will render text without any anti aliasing

Number of images: how many images to generate
Start i: at what number will the file names start
